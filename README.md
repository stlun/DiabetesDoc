## What is DiabetesDoc
DiabetesDoc is a software to save and transform the data of your diabetes therapy which are read by a Accu-Chek
SmartPix device. This software can automatically save the data from the SmartPix device on your hard drive in a
format which is also compatible for use with Unix/Linux. Additional Output of the data as diary in .PDF-format 
is possible.

## Installation and dependencies
For this software, you need to have a current *Java Runtime* as well as *bash*, *make* and *maven* installed.
*convert* is recommended, but not necessary. Additionally you need an Accu-Chek SmartPix device.

To install the software in a local directory, you need to clone or download the git project and run `make install`
in the main directory.

## Usage
After you have read your devices with the Accu-Chek SmartPix device, you have to start the java application
`DiabetesDoc.jar`.

You can use it to copy the data to the *reports* directory and to set up the internal data storage in the
*xml* directory or to to create a *diary* in .PDF-format.
